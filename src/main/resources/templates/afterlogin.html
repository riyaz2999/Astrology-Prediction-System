In the face of competition, remember that your angels are holding up a custom magic wand for you so don't fret about a thing. Choose the most exciting option for you and feel free to go learn new things if you need to. Seek out advice from mentors or experienced figures this month to move forward with confidence. The best way to check in with yourself is to write down every thought, idea and emotion, circle back to it from a neutral space before making decisions.

Just look around to find the missing links and remember that you are divinely protected, so don't scramble around for change. Take your time to select your favourite cup before you begin filling it up.. Huge changes are being triggered for you this month and the Universe is talking to you in numbers.

However, the key theme this month for you would be maintaining mental balance and acuity. Powerful shifts are happening for you around the eclipse. So, while you have put in serious efforts in trying to forge out a cast iron armour for yourself, here’s a gentle reminder - to be aware of not letting previous dissatisfaction or boredom influence this phase of life. Instead, adopt a fresh perspective. Allow the contentment from your personal life flow over into your work life and see the magic that conspires.
